# This is the current work in progress github page for the AIO costume pack project

## Concept

P3P sucks with it's costume support, in basically every department. The lack of options, the fact that you are forced into outfits because of armor, no dedicated costume slots, the works. 

This mod aims to address some of those issues using R2's configuration support to enable more player choice. 

You'll be able to choose the outfit you'd like to use, meaning you're no longer forced to use an entire outfit set at once when using a mod. On top of that, you're also able to choose the default outfit the costume replaces, no longer are you forced to use the High-cut armor outfit during the early game.

Other options include randomization support, enabling a different costume to be chosen on every game boot. As well as a just for fun riddle system, enabling players to unlock outfits outside of the game.

This will include every costume mod I've published, plus exclusive additions, and work by others wherever possible.
